            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Do Your Homework:</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">Before investing, research the company or opportunity. Verify their legitimacy through official financial regulators and look up reviews or complaints online. If something feels off, trust your instincts.</p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Question High Returns:</h3>
    <p className="mb-4 text-lg">Be cautious of any investment promising unusually high returns with little risk. Scammers often lure victims with guarantees that are too good to be true. Remember, legitimate investments come with risks.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Take Your Time:</h3>
    <p className="text-lg">Scammers often create a false sense of urgency, pushing you to invest immediately. Take your time to evaluate the offer carefully and consult with a trusted financial advisor if necessary.</p>
  
    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Protect Your Information:</h3>
    <p className="text-lg">Never share your financial details, like bank account numbers or credit card information, with someone you donâ€™t know or trust. Be especially wary of unsolicited investment offers that require personal information upfront.
